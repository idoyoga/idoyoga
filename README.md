# Daniel Plötzl

Junior SOC / Blue Team cybersecurity candidate completing the Computer Software Engineering program at 42 Vienna (project-base, peer-to-peer) with focus on incident response, security operations, log analysis, and Linux systems.

My background combines hands-on systems engineering training with several years of experience in high-responsibility environments. This translates into strong analytical thinking, structured problem solving, and reliability under pressure.

## Technical Focus

- Incident response: log analysis, alert triage, threat investigation
- Security operations: authentication, access control, hardening, monitoring
- Linux security: system administration, SSH hardening, firewall configuration, permissions
- Network security: TCP/IP protocols, client/server architecture, traffic analysis
- Scripting and automation: bash, parsing logs, security tool development

## Current Focus

- Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows
- Incident analysis and alert triage
- Defensive security fundamentals
- System behavior and attack surface reduction

## Selected Projects

- **auth-triage – SSH authentication log analyzer**
  SOC triage tool for analyzing failed SSH attempts, brute-force detection, credential stuffing

- **Born2BeRoot – Linux hardening & baseline security**  
  Hardened Linux VM, access control, SSH hardening, firewalling, monitoring  
  → https://github.com/idoyoga/born2beroot-hardening

- **Minishell – Unix shell implementation**  
  Custom shell in C: parsing, pipes, redirections, heredoc, env expansion, signals  
  → https://github.com/idoyoga/minishell

## Background

Before transitioning into cybersecurity and systems engineering, I worked in program management, organisational development, and operational roles in high-responsibility environments. This background strengthens my ability to operate in structured, process-driven contexts such as security operations.

## Location

Vienna, Austria  
Open to on-site and hybrid roles starting 2026

# Daniel Plötzl

Junior SOC / Blue Team cybersecurity candidate completing the Computer Software Engineering program at 42 Vienna (project-based, peer-to-peer) with focus on incident response, security operations, log analysis, and Linux systems.

My background combines hands-on technical training with several years of experience in high-responsibility environments (program management, operations, organizational development). This translates into strong analytical thinking, structured incident handling, clear communication under pressure, and reliability in security operations.

# Daniel Plötzl

Junior SOC / Blue Team–focused cybersecurity candidate currently completing the Computer Software Engineering program at 42 Vienna, with a strong emphasis on Linux systems, networking, and systems programming.

My background combines hands-on systems engineering training with several years of experience in high-responsibility environments. This translates into strong analytical thinking, structured problem solving, and reliability under pressure.

## Technical Focus

- Linux systems, processes, permissions, and file systems  
- Networking fundamentals, TCP/IP, client/server models  
- Log analysis and operational troubleshooting
- Process control, signals, and file descriptor management  
- Secure coding principles, input validation and error handling
- C and C++ programming, memory management, debugging    

## Current Focus

- Defensive security fundamentals  
- Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows  
- Incident analysis and alert triage  
- System behavior and attack surface reduction  

## Selected Projects

- **Born2BeRoot – Linux hardening & baseline security**  
  Hardened Linux VM, access control, SSH hardening, firewalling, monitoring

- **Minishell – Unix shell implementation**  
  Custom shell in C: parsing, pipes, redirections, heredoc, env expansion, signals  
  → https://github.com/idoyoga/minishell

## Background

Before transitioning into cybersecurity and systems engineering, I worked in programme management, organisational development, and operational roles in high-responsibility environments. This background strengthens my ability to operate in structured, process-driven contexts such as security operations.

## Location

Vienna, Austria  
Open to on-site and hybrid roles starting 2026
